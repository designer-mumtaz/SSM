"attribute" and "property"
===========================

What's the difference between an "attribute" and a "property"?
In general terms (and in normal English usage) the terms mean the same thing.
In the specific context of HTML / Javascript the terms get confused because the HTML representation of a DOM element has attributes (that being the term used in XML for the key/value pairs contained within a tag) but when represented as a JavaScript object those attributes appear as object properties.
